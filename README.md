coop-georgia-website
====================

The Coop Georgia website (Jekyll)


Notes
-----

- not using layouts because I just want the static site up; however later I should be able to use layouts, _includes, and so on
- still need to set up GA



Todo
----

- get more info on partners
- figure out steps to get it up on github
- send to tako/natia for translation
- write to nicolas/wilhelm





change requests
- home page finish
- you don't need to worry about the georgian text on the site, but could you make sure the menu links are translated and look okay, because I imagine the text will be a little longer than the English
- on the services/business and services/home pages could you please change the text on the images to read "Glass" instead of "Cans"?  Can you also make sure that we have Georgian versions of these images?
- on get involved page I wonder if the headings for each of the four sections ought to be in the same style?
