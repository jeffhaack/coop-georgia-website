====================

The Coop Georgia website (Jekyll)


Notes
-----

- not using layouts because I just want the static site up; however later I should be able to use layouts, _includes, and so on
- still need to set up GA



Todo
----

- get more info on partners
- check content page by page and make to list
- figure out steps to get it up on github
- copy english over into Georgian
- send to tako/natia for translation
- write to nicolas/wilhelm
