          Where can I drop off my recycling?

        <p class="faq-answer">
          Right now we only have one public bin location, at the old entrance to the Hippodrome.  
          We are working to offer more public drop off points in the future.  You may also consider <link>organizing community bins</link>.

        <p class="faq-question">
          What are community bins?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          While we cannot yet offer recycling pickup at individual homes, some neighborhoods have joined together to recycle as a group.  
          It is possible to for you to organize bins for your neighborhood or apartment building, and sign up for our recycling service.  
          Call us for more information about organizing community bins.

        <p class="faq-answer">
          We are not yet able to recycle Tetrapacks, which have paper on the outside and plastic on the inside (such as milk cartons). 
           We also do not yet deal with compost, batteries, and certain types of plastic, such as plastic cups. We cannot yet recycle tin cans.
