		  <h2>Recycle at Home</h2>
		  <p>
      <b>Recycling starts at home</b>, by considering your and your family’s habits when it comes to waste.  
      Did you know that about half of the waste in an average household can be composted, keeping it out of landfills? 
      And of the remaining waste, up to 60% can be recycled!  This means that you could reduce by up to 80% the waste you send to landfills!
    </p>
    <p>
      The first step to getting involved is to start recycling at home.  Visit <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/en/services/home">“Recycling at Home”</a> for more information.

		  <h2>Organize <b>Community Bins</b></h2>
		  <p>
      <b>A great way to get involved is to get others involved!</b>  
      Talk to your neighbors about recycling and encourage them to participate as well.  
      If you can organize your neighborhood or apartment building to recycle together, 
      we can provide you with the necessary bins and our free pickup service.  
      Contact us today to get started!
