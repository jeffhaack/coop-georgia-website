        Recycling is the process of using waste materials to create new products.  
        Instead of burying our waste in landfills which threaten the environment, 
        we can return it to the resource pool, thereby reducing the extraction and consumption of new raw materials from the earth.  
        Recycling reduces energy usage, air pollution and water pollution, which in turn offers us all healthier lives.  
        By responsibly separating our waste, we have a positive impact by protecting the environment, conserving energy, and keeping Georgia beautiful.

        As the economy grows, more products are consumed and more waste is created, which ultimately is buried or burned in landfills.  
        Burning waste diminishes the health of the millions of people who breathe polluted air.  
        Buried waste leaks into underground water systems, contaminating the water which ultimately is used on the crops we eat, 
        in the water supplies where we drink, and in the lakes where we swim.
