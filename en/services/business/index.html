    What does it cost?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
    The recycling service is free.  Clients are asked to pay a startup fee to pay for the cost of the bins, which is 100 GEL per bin.

  <p class="faq-question">
    Where does the recycling go?
  </p>
  <p class="faq-answer">
    We work with various factories and firms who repurpose recyclable materials. In Georgia paper is recycled to make toilet paper and glass is reprocessed to make new bottles. Plastic is currently exported, but we hope it will be possible to recycle it in Georgia in the future.

    I am an office manager. How and why should we recycle?
  </p>
  <p class="faq-answer">
    Offices produce a LOT of paper. Save it from going into a landfill! Paper can be recycled to make many things, such as toilet paper and other paper products. Recycling one ton of paper saves 17 trees, 25,000 liters of water, and 4,000 kWh of electricity!

    I am a restaurant manager. How and why should we recycle?
  </p>
  <p class="faq-answer">
    Restaurants produce a LOT of glass and plastic, which ends up in a landfill. 
    It's easy to put these materials in separate bins, and sign up for our pickup service. 
    You can place our stickers on the front of your restaurant, informing your customers that your business cares about the environment. 
    Call us today to set up a meeting!

  <p class="faq-question">
    How often will you pick up our recycling?
  </p>
  <p class="faq-answer">
    This varies depending on your needs.  
    If you have a steady flow of recyclable waste, we can schedule regular pickups. 
    If it is more variable or you experience spikes in quantity (for example, if you are a restaurant with occasional busy days), 
    you can call us and schedule pickups as needed.
