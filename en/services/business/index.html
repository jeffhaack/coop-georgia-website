    I am a restaurant manager. How and why should we recycle?
  </p>
  <p class="faq-answer">
    Restaurants produce a LOT of glass and plastic, which ends up in a landfill. 
    It's easy to put these materials in separate bins, and sign up for our pickup service. 
    You can place our stickers on the front of your restaurant, informing your customers that your business cares about the environment. 
    Call us today to set up a meeting!

  <p class="faq-question">
    How often will you pick up our recycling?
  </p>
  <p class="faq-answer">
    This varies depending on your needs.  
    If you have a steady flow of recyclable waste, we can schedule regular pickups. 
    If it is more variable or you experience spikes in quantity (for example, if you are a restaurant with occasional busy days), 
    you can call us and schedule pickups as needed.
