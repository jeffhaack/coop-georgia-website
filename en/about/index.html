		  Coop Georgia was founded in 2012 by a group of Tbilisi residents to develop recycling services and improve the environment in Georgia. 
		  We have built our Tbilisi recycling service from the ground up and already service over 50 businesses, organizations and schools.
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
		  As a social enterprise, Coop Georgia is not led by profit. 
		  Our objective is to create a sustainable model for recycling in which surpluses are continually reinvested into environmental activities.

		  <h3>Nicolas Guibert</h3>
		  <p>
			  One day, in 2012, Nicolas decided that dropping his glass bottles in the municipal waste container was enough!  
			  Coop Georgia Recycling was born. 
		  </p>
		  <p>
        Living in Tbilisi since 2011, he dedicates a large part of his time to get making his ideas about recycling come true.  
        Nicolas volunteers his time, assisting Wilhelm in the overall management of the recycling program.
		  </p>
		  <p>
        By profession he is an adviser in the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene sector, 
        but also gets involved in other projects in Georgia - such as launching a monthly French speaking newspaper!

		  <h3>Klaus Buchholz</h3>
		  <p>
        Well this is Klaus...some call him Santa Claus, knowing him means knowing why.  
        Klaus is a 54 years young water engineer who hails from Germany.  
        From 2011-2013 he worked in Georgia as project manager of an EIB funded water supply project in 9 towns across Georgia.
		  </p>
		  <p>
        While touring the country on his motorbike, Klaus found many picnic sites covered in glass and plastic bottles, even around churches.  
        He started to collect them, even though at the time he did not really know how it would be possible to recycle.  
        Thus, together with Nicolas and Wilhelm, the idea of Coop Georgia was born.  And why did they form a cooperative?  
        Because it is open to all people who believe in our mission.

		  <h3>Evelyn Kamber</h3>
		  <p>
			  At the tender age of three Evelyn made her first contact with nature while climbing a huge pine tree.  
			  Since then, nature and environmental protection have always been important to her.
		  </p>
		  <p>
        Trained as a forest scientist/engineer, Evelyn chose to work in different organisations in the field of nature protection, 
        natural resource management, and climate change and sustainability. 
        Living in Tbilisi with her family since early 2014, she was excited to find a possibility to recycle plastic and 
        glass bottles and is thrilled to invest her knowledge with Coop Georgia.
