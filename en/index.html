      <h3>The Green Office Campaign</h3>
      <p>Every day all of us make decisions that affect global warming, air pollution, and other environmental issues.
       
      <p>Our everyday practices in our workplace are among factors that can affect our environments in more or less negative ways – depending, again, on our choices and decisions. To list just a few:</p>
       
      <p>Have we ever considered whether we really need to overheat the office? Maybe we could fix our heaters two degrees lower and take on an extra sweeter, instead of the pleasure of getting around in t-shirts at the expense of the resources and emissions that extra heating takes? After all, why not to enjoy all the four seasons and let their diversity reflect in our outfits?</p>
       
      <p>Have we ever considered were the waste accumulated in our offices goes? The accumulation of a lot of waste in our offices is a huge contributor to various environmental problems. But it is also a factor whose impact can be alleviated through conscious minimizing of office consumables use, on the one hand, and putting efforts to getting our waste recycled, on the other.</p>
       
      <p>Does any of us ever consider whether we really need to go to the other end of the city to settle a minor issue? Maybe a phone call or an e-mail message would do? Again, do we really need to drive separately to our workplaces? Maybe we could share rides or simply walk or bike to our offices? Any means for minimizing your office-related transportation not only saves your money but also contributes to saving our planet.</p>
       
      <p>The phrase "Green Office" refers to the mentality and practices that help to reduce the environmental impact of our office activities and make a real difference.</p>
       
      <p>CENN  and Coop Georgia are conducting a campaign to involve more offices in green practices.
      The main component of the Green Office Campaign is encouraging offices to separate waste, as well as helping them to get rid of the separated waste through organizing its regular pick-up.
      Collect your paper waste, we’ll call you by the end of each month and organize pick-up accordingly.</p>
       
      <p>If you want  to be kind to the environment,
      If you share our conviction that each of us can make a difference,
      We are there to help you.</p>
       
      <p>GO GREEN!</p>

		  <h3>What is Recycling?</h3>
		  <p>
		    Recycling is the process of using waste materials to create new products.  
		    Instead of burying our waste in landfills which threaten the environment, 
		    we can return it to the resource pool, thereby reducing the extraction and consumption of new raw materials from the earth.
    Recycling reduces energy usage, air pollution and water pollution, which in turn offers us all healthier lives.  
    By responsibly separating our waste, we have a positive impact by protecting the environment, conserving energy, and keeping Georgia beautiful.
		  </p>
      <p>As the economy grows, more products are consumed and more waste is created, which ultimately is buried or burned in landfills. Burning waste diminishes the health of the millions of people who breathe polluted air.</p>
